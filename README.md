## User Segmentation
I conducted the user segmentation by applying the Recency-Frequency-Monetary framework to calculate the R, F, M value for each users.
And I applied K-Menas clusting method to each user's R, F, M values, and segmented the users into four groups:
- At-Risk
- New Customers
- Loyal Customers
- Potential Loyalist
And I analyzed the sales portion of each user groups, and offered retention strategy.

## Product&Brand&Category Segmentation
I condected the segmentation to product&brand&category by calculating the retention rate for each product&brand&category:
View-Purchase(VP): rate of item purchased from viewed
View-Cart(VC): rate of item added from viewed
Cart-Purchase(CP): rate of item added from viewed
Cart-Remove(CR): rate of item removed from addedde

## Sales
I forecast the sales, and calculated the top selling day&time within half year and day.
